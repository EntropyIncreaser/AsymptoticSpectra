This is a (toy) project to formalize the theory of asymptotic spectra, a theory developed by Volker Strassen. This framework of this project is based on the survey [Asymptotic Spectra: Theory, Applications and Extensions](https://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/WigdersonZu_Final_Draft_Oct2023.pdf) by Avi Wigderson and Jeroen Zuiddam.
